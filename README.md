Horror Maze 2D Game

🎮 Project Title: Whispers in the Dark (Feel free to change the title!)

🕹️ Project Description:
Whispers in the Dark is a spine-chilling 2D horror game developed in Unity that plunges players into a mysterious, atmospheric world where every shadow hides a secret. Designed to create an immersive psychological horror experience, the game combines eerie soundscapes, unsettling visuals, and a gripping narrative that keeps players on edge.

Players take on the role of a protagonist trapped in an abandoned facility (or haunted town/mansion—your choice!) with no memory of how they got there. As they explore dimly lit corridors and solve cryptic puzzles, players must evade lurking horrors that react to light, sound, and movement. The gameplay focuses on jump scares, with pixel art that enhance the unsettling environment.

✨ Key Features:

🎨 Unique Art Style: Dark, atmospheric 2D visuals with hand-crafted environments.
🎧 Immersive Audio: Dynamic sound design that responds to player actions and builds tension.
🕯️ Resource Management: Limited light sources and tools, forcing strategic decision-making.

I created this game all alone in 12 hrs of time starting with little knowledge of game development !!

Thanks for reading.
